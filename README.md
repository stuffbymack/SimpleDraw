# SimpleDraw

SimpleDraw is a lightweight Java application designed to provide a straightforward and efficient tool for creating digital drawings. It emphasizes a minimalistic interface to facilitate ease of use and allow developers to navigate and understand its architecture without unnecessary complexity.

## Core Features

- **Lightweight Interface**: The application is designed to minimize system resource usage and ensure high performance, making it an excellent choice for environments where system resources are limited.

- **Fixed Canvas Size**: SimpleDraw operates on a 512x512 pixel canvas. This fixed size facilitates a standardized drawing environment and simplifies the handling of artistic content within the application.

- **Fixed Brush Size**: The application utilizes a fixed 15-pixel brush size for all drawing operations. This specification aids in maintaining a consistent style and precision in the creation process.

- **Windows Vista Paint Color Palette**: For color selection, the application includes the classic Windows Vista Paint color palette. This retro palette brings a bit of nostalgia and offers a wide range of color options to satisfy most artistic requirements.

- **PNG Image Saving**: SimpleDraw supports the saving of artwork in the PNG image format. This functionality ensures compatibility with a wide variety of image viewing and editing applications.

- **Canvas Clearing Option**: An option to clear the entire canvas is also provided. This functionality simplifies starting new drawings and reduces the need for manual clearing.

## Installation

Clone and navigate to the repository, compile the Java file and run the application using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/SimpleDraw.git
cd SimpleDraw
javac SimpleDraw.java

## Usage

Upon launching the application, a user may select a color from the palette and use the cursor to draw on the canvas. The "Save as PNG" option allows the artwork to be saved, while the "Clear Canvas" button provides a fresh canvas for new drawings.
